# Machine-learning-Project-1
Objective:
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that classifies forest
cover types based on cartographic features such as elevation, soil type, and
climatic conditions. The project will include a comparison of various classification
algorithms and their performance, both before and after hyperparameter tuning.
