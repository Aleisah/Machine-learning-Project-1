# Machine-learning-Project-1
Objective:
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that classifies forest
cover types based on cartographic features such as elevation, soil type, and
climatic conditions. The project will include a comparison of various classification
algorithms and their performance, both before and after hyperparameter tuning.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the Forest Cover Type dataset available on
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset.
The dataset contains 54 features, including ~40 binary columns representing
different soil types. The target variable is the forest cover type, which has 7
distinct classes.
